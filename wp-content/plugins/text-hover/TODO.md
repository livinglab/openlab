# TODO

The following list comprises ideas, suggestions, and known issues, all of which are in consideration for possible implementation in future releases.

***This is not a roadmap or a task list.*** Just because something is listed does not necessarily mean it will ever actually get implemented. Some might be bad ideas. Some might be impractical. Some might either not benefit enough users to justify the effort or might negatively impact too many existing users. Or I may not have the time to devote to the task.

* Shortcode and template tag to display listing of all supported text hovers (filterable)
* Switch to pure-CSS tooltips? See: https://medium.com/two-factor-authenticity/tiny-design-bite-transitioning-tooltip-text-with-pseudo-elements-hover-states-82fbe00e8c33
* Metabox to display listing of all supported text hovers
* Smarter input form for text hovers. Repeatable field with sub-fields name and hover text. (This will allow having multiline hover text).
* Ability for users to set the text color, background color, and border color of their tooltips.
* Settings page text area for testing sample text. Use AJAX to fetch parsed text from server for display. Applies same styles as it would on frontend.
* Add setting to specify additional filters to be handled by the plugin.
* Add support for `c2c_text_hover_filter_priority`, similar to what Text Replace does

Feel free to make your own suggestions or champion for something already on the list (via the [plugin's support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/text-hover/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/coffee2code/text-hover/) as an issue or PR).
