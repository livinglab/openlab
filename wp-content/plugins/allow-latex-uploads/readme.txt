Allows LaTeX and related file uploads.

== Description ==

Ever noticed that when you try to upload a `.tex` file to your WordPress blog, it's mysteriously blocked? This plugin simply allows for LaTeX file uploading.

In particular, it supports the `.tex`, `.latex`, `.ps`, and `.dvi` extensions. `.pdf` is already supported by the WordPress core.

This plugin is a component of the [MIT Educational Collaboration Space](http://ecs.mit.edu) project at the [MIT Department of Mathematics](http://math.mit.edu/).
